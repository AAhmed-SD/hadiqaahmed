# 👋 Hey, I’m Hadiqa Ahmed

I’m a 22-year-old Computer Science student and founder building AI-first SaaS products focused on productivity, automation, and spiritual growth.

I build AI-first tools that create **mental clarity**, drive **consistent self-growth**, and make room for what truly matters — in **worship**, **work**, **health**, and beyond.

Most software I create is rooted in what I live: **Islam**, **self-discipline**, **deep focus**, and **intentional living**, **optimizing my time so I can spend more of it on what actually fulfills me.**.  

Right now, I’m fully in build mode — crafting systems that automate the noise, so users can stay locked in on their real goals.
